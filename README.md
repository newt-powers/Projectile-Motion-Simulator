This a projectile motion simulator written in C++. Once running the program, you must enter a projectile speed in meters per second and the angle above the ground in degrees in the terminal. Once this is achieved, the total time in the air, the total horizontal distance, and the height of the apex are all printed to the screen. To run this program, use the git clone command with the project link in your directory.
